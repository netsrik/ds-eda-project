## Introduction
To practice EDA, DataFrame reshaping and plotting, I work myself through the following data kaggle data of house sales in King County.

To have an objective I do this work as a fictional person who works in a fictional company for a fictional stakeholder. The results you can find [here](2022-01-27_presentation.pdf).

All the details about what I did are within the [notebook](EDA_King_Count_House_Prices.ipynb).

## Data
If you want to have a look at the data for yourself, you find them on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). <br>
These are not exactly the data I was using, because for practice some of my data was worsened. But this should only have an impact on the data cleaning part.
