## Introduction
To practice EDA, dataframe reshaping and plotting, I work myself through the following data kaggle data of house sales in King County.

To have an objective I do this work as a fictional person who works in a fictional company for a fictional stakeholder. The results you can find [here](2022-01-27_presentation.pdf).

All the details about what I did are within the [notebook](EDA_King_Count_House_Prices.ipynb).
